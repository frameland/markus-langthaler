		It simply checks if a tile is either blocked or occupied by a character.

		Additionally it supports blocking only certain directions. This is useful for different heights or bridges.
		A collision tile can be any combination of left,right,up and down.<br>

		When leaving the tile, it is set back to the remembered state.
